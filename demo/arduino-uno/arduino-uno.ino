/* picoRTOS blink demo code for Arduino Uno
 * Arduino IDE doesn't allow for complex project structures so you need to add picoRTOS files manually.
 * For this, just select Sketch -> Add File... and add the following files:
 *  - picoRTOS.c
 *  - picoRTOS.h
 *  - arch/avr/avr5/picoRTOS_port.c
 *  - arch/avr/avr5/picoRTOS_portasm.S
 *  - arch/avr/avr5/picoRTOS_types.h
 *
 * Alternatively, you can generate the sketch in sketch/arduino-due by typing
 * # make sketch
 *
 * If you have arduino-cli installed you can try :
 * # make
 * # make upload
 *  
 *  Some good soul might be able to make a library for this in the future
